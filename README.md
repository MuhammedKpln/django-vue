# Django + Vue boilerplate
Another Django + Vue boilerplate but in Laravel way! Well you no longer need create two seperate folder for backend and frontend. Eveything is already up and running!


# Set up
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`\
`$ cd src`\
`$ npm install`\
`$ python manage.py migrate`\
`$ python manage.py runserver`\
`
